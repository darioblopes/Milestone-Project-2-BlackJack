# Milestone-Project-2-BlackJack
This project idea is from "Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Course" By Jose Portilla on UDEMY.com

# This project creates BlackJack and allows the end-user to play against the dealer. 
Postive: Completing this project was helpful since I got more practice with functions in python and classes.
